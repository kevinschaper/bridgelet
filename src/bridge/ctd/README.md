# Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)

CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding about how environmental exposures affect human health. It provides manually curated information about chemical–gene/protein interactions, chemical–disease and gene–disease relationships. These data are integrated with functional and pathway data to aid in development of hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying environmentally influenced diseases.

[Chemical to Disease](#chemical_to_disease)

This ingest takes only the chemical to disease rows where a direct evidence label is applied, and creates ChemicalEntity and Disease nodes connected by a ChemicalToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation. The the chemical ID row is expected to need a 'MESH:' prefix added, the disease id is used as-is. 

Rows are included only if the direct evidence field is 'therapeutic' and the `biolink:treats_or_applied_or_studied_to_treat` predicate is used to avoid making too strong a claim.

* ChemicalToDiseaseOrPhenotypicFeatureAssociation
  * id (random uuid)
  * subject (chemical id)
  * predicate (`biolink:affects`)
  * object (disease id)
  * publication (pubmed ids provided by file)  
  * primary_knowledge_source (`infores:ctd`)

* ChemicalEntity
  * id (chemical id)
  * name (chemical name)
  * category (`biolink:ChemicalEntity`)

* Disease
  * id (disease id)
  * name (disease name)
  * category (`biolink:Disease`)

Note: The ChemicalEntity and Disease nodes here are placeholders only and lack a full representation node properties, and may not accurately reflect the correct biolink category.
